Currently working on:

- Learning React to improve my web dev skills
- Pixel Phantom, a indie game which involves action packed PVE and dynamic lighting
- Simple Chat Bot, a AI powered custom chat bot which lets you talk and interact through a online chat on a website

Please note that the larger games (Cat climbers, Pixel Phantoms and VR Whack a Mole) wont be on the github and will have thier own websites on completion
