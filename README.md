Currently working on:

- Cat climbers, a spit screen co-op game for your browser which is similar to Jump King
- Pixel Phantoms, a multiplayer online game for 3 players which involves action packed PVE and dynamic lighting
- Duck Chat, a AI powered custom chat bot which lets you talk and interact through a online chat with a duck
- VR Whack-A-Mole, My first attempt at making a game using Virtual Reality!

Please note that the larger games (Cat climbers, Pixel Phantoms and VR Whack a Mole) wont be on the github and will have thier own websites on completion
